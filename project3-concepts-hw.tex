\begin{questions}
\question Working individually, generate 3-5 \textbf{concept designs} for your device. For each, make a sketch or sketches (Pictionary-grade) with enough text to convey the message. Consider the functional requirements you identified in class. A concept design is the overall idea, you need not have yet worked out the details... but try to think of wildly different concept designs rather than small variations on the same one, in order to brainstorm as broadly as possible. 

\question Be prepared to trade your work with your partner \textbf{at the start of next class}, when you will discuss with your partner how to move forward. Are there test you want to perform? Is there benchmarking you need to do to look at similar devices? Are there prototypes you need to build and try before deciding on a final concept design? 

\question Update your (individual) Engineering Design Notebooks to include what you have worked on today. (As in, if you complete this assignment satisfactorily and put it in your Design Notebook it counts as the \textbf{mandatory entry} for today...)
